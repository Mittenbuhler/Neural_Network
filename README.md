## About the Project
This repository contains a PyPI package for the recognition of handwritten digits using a neural network. Only numpy is used for the implementation of the neural network itself. The project was created in the context of a programming course at the University of Amsterdam. It therefore rather serves illustrative than practical purposes.

The package also includes a GUI, which allows to draw a number and have it recognized by the neural network.
